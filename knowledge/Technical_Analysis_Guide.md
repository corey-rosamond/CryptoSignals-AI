## 📊 TECHNICAL INDICATORS MASTERY

### 1. TREND INDICATORS

#### Moving Averages (MA)
**Simple MA (SMA):** Average price over N periods
**Exponential MA (EMA):** More weight to recent prices
**Common Periods:** 20, 50, 100, 200

**Trading Strategies:**
- Price above MA = Uptrend bias
- MA crossovers (Golden Cross: 50 MA above 200 MA)
- Dynamic support/resistance levels

**Crypto Optimization:**
- 12/26 EMA for short-term (instead of 20/50)
- 100/200 EMA for long-term trend
- Use EMA in volatile crypto markets

#### MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)
**Components:**
- MACD Line: 12 EMA - 26 EMA
- Signal Line: 9 EMA of MACD Line
- Histogram: MACD - Signal

**Signals:**
- MACD above Signal = Bullish momentum
- MACD below Signal = Bearish momentum
- Zero line crossovers indicate trend change
- Divergences signal potential reversals

**Crypto Settings:** 8-17-9 for faster signals

#### ADX (Average Directional Index)
**Range:** 0-100
**Interpretation:**
- Above 25: Strong trend
- Below 20: Weak/no trend
- Above 50: Very strong trend

**Components:**
- +DI: Positive directional indicator
- -DI: Negative directional indicator
- ADX: Strength of trend (direction agnostic)

### 2. MOMENTUM INDICATORS

#### RSI (Relative Strength Index)
**Range:** 0-100
**Standard Levels:**
- Above 70: Overbought (potential sell)
- Below 30: Oversold (potential buy)

**Crypto Adjustments:**
- Use 80/20 levels in bull markets
- Use 20/10 levels in bear markets
- 14-period standard, try 7 for faster signals

**Advanced RSI Strategies:**
- RSI divergence (price vs RSI direction)
- RSI trendlines
- Hidden divergence for continuation

#### Stochastic Oscillator
**Components:** %K (fast line), %D (slow line)
**Range:** 0-100
**Signals:**
- Above 80: Overbought
- Below 20: Oversold
- %K crossing above %D: Buy signal
- %K crossing below %D: Sell signal

#### Williams %R
**Range:** -100 to 0
**Signals:**
- Above -20: Overbought
- Below -80: Oversold
- Opposite of Stochastic (inverted scale)

### 3. VOLUME INDICATORS

#### Volume Profile
**Purpose:** Shows volume traded at each price level
**Key Concepts:**
- POC (Point of Control): Price with highest volume
- Value Area: 70% of volume (support/resistance zone)
- Volume nodes: High volume areas act as magnets

#### OBV (On-Balance Volume)
**Calculation:**
- Volume added if close > previous close
- Volume subtracted if close < previous close
- Running total creates OBV line

**Signals:**
- OBV trend should confirm price trend
- Divergences signal potential reversals
- Breakouts with volume confirmation

#### Accumulation/Distribution Line
**Purpose:** Measures buying vs selling pressure
**Calculation:** Based on close position within daily range
**Interpretation:**
- Rising = Accumulation (bullish)
- Falling = Distribution (bearish)

### 4. VOLATILITY INDICATORS

#### Bollinger Bands
**Components:**
- Middle Band: 20 SMA
- Upper Band: Middle + (2 × Standard Deviation)
- Lower Band: Middle - (2 × Standard Deviation)

**Trading Strategies:**
- Price touching upper band: Overbought
- Price touching lower band: Oversold
- Band squeeze: Low volatility, breakout coming
- Band expansion: High volatility period

**Crypto Optimization:** Use 15-period with 2.2 std dev

#### ATR (Average True Range)
**Purpose:** Measures volatility (not direction)
**Calculation:** Average of true ranges over N periods
**Uses:**
- Position sizing (higher ATR = smaller position)
- Stop loss placement (1-2x ATR from entry)
- Volatility breakout identification

## 🎯 SUPPORT AND RESISTANCE

### 1. HORIZONTAL LEVELS

#### Psychological Levels
- Round numbers (10,000, 50,000, 100,000)

- Price often bounces off these levels
- Acts as dynamic support in uptrends

#### Trendlines
**Drawing Rules:**
- Connect minimum 2 points (3+ for stronger lines)
- Don't force lines through too many points
- Steeper lines break faster

**Types:**
- Uptrend Line: Connect low points
- Downtrend Line: Connect high points
- Channel Lines: Parallel support/resistance

### 3. FIBONACCI LEVELS

#### Fibonacci Retracements
**Key Levels:** 23.6%, 38.2%, 50%, 61.8%, 78.6%
**Most Important:** 38.2% and 61.8%
**Usage:**
- Draw from swing low to swing high (uptrend)
- Draw from swing high to swing low (downtrend)
- Look for bounces at these levels

#### Fibonacci Extensions
**Levels:** 127.2%, 161.8%, 200%, 261.8%
**Usage:** Project profit targets beyond 100%
**Drawing:** From swing low → swing high → pullback low
