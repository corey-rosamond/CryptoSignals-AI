# ðŸ¥’ PHASE 1: MVP GPT CREATION - GHERKIN SCENARIOS

## Feature: GPT Basic Configuration

```gherkin
Feature: GPT Basic Configuration
  As a GPT developer
  I want to configure the basic GPT settings
  So that users can identify and use my trading bot

  Background:
    Given I have ChatGPT Plus access
    And I can access the GPT builder
    And I have prepared all assets

  Scenario: Setting GPT Identity
    Given I am in the GPT configuration page
    When I set the name to "CryptoSignals AI - 75%+ Accuracy Trading Bot"
    And I write a description "Professional crypto trading signals with confidence scores"
    And I upload a 1024x1024 logo
    Then the GPT should display the name correctly
    And the description should be visible
    And the logo should appear in the chat

  Scenario: Configuring Capabilities
    Given I am in the capabilities section
    When I enable Web Browsing
    And I enable Code Interpreter
    And I disable DALL-E image generation
    Then the GPT should be able to fetch web data
    And the GPT should be able to perform calculations
    And the GPT should not generate images

  Scenario: Visibility Settings
    Given I have configured the basic GPT
    When I set visibility to "Anyone with link"
    And I save the configuration
    Then the GPT should be accessible via link
    And it should not appear in public search yet
    And I should be able to share it with testers
```

## Feature: Core Instructions Implementation

```gherkin
Feature: Core Instructions Implementation
  As a GPT developer
  I want to write comprehensive instructions
  So that the GPT behaves as an expert trader

  Scenario: Personality Configuration
    Given I am writing GPT instructions
    When I define the personality as:
      """
      You are an expert cryptocurrency trading analyst with 10+ years experience
      in technical analysis, risk management, and market psychology.
      """
    Then the GPT should respond as an expert
    And it should demonstrate confidence
    And it should use professional terminology

  Scenario: Analysis Framework Setup
    Given the personality is configured
    When I implement the analysis structure:
      | Component       | Format                          |
      | Current Price   | Display with timestamp          |
      | Trend Analysis  | Bullish/Bearish/Neutral        |
      | Signal          | BUY/SELL/HOLD                   |
      | Entry Price     | Specific price level            |
      | Stop Loss       | Risk management level           |
      | Take Profit     | 3 target levels                 |
      | Confidence      | 0-100% score                    |
    Then every analysis should follow this structure
    And all components should be present
    And formatting should be consistent

  Scenario: Risk Disclaimer Implementation
    Given I need legal compliance
    When I add disclaimer instructions:
      """
      ALWAYS include "Not financial advice. DYOR" at the end
      NEVER guarantee profits
      ALWAYS mention risks involved
      """
    Then every response should include disclaimer
    And disclaimer should be prominent
    And it should be impossible to skip

  Scenario: Confidence Scoring Logic
    Given I want transparent confidence scores
    When I implement scoring based on:
      | Factor              | Weight |
      | Indicator Alignment | 40%    |
      | Market Trend        | 30%    |
      | Volume Confirmation | 20%    |
      | Historical Pattern  | 10%    |
    Then confidence should calculate correctly
    And score should be 0-100%
    And reasoning should be explained

  Scenario: Monetization Hook Placement
    Given I want to generate revenue
    When I add natural product mentions:
      """
      After high-confidence signals: "Get my complete toolkit..."
      For educational queries: "Learn more in my comprehensive guide..."
      On successful analysis: "Join 1000+ traders using..."
      """
    Then hooks should appear naturally
    And they should not be pushy
    And frequency should be appropriate
```

    Then the guide should be comprehensive
    And it should be 5+ pages
    And it should include calculations

  Scenario: Trading Glossary Compilation
    Given I need terminology reference
    When I compile 100+ trading terms
    And I provide clear definitions
