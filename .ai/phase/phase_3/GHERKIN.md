# ðŸ¥’ PHASE 3: PERFORMANCE TRACKING - GHERKIN SCENARIOS

## Feature: Performance Tracking System

```gherkin
Feature: Performance Tracking System
  As a transparent GPT operator
  I want to track and display performance metrics
  So that users can verify accuracy claims

  Background:
    Given I have a Google account
    And I have access to Google Sheets
    And the GPT is generating predictions

  Scenario: Setting Up Tracking Spreadsheet
    Given I create a new Google Sheet
    When I set up the structure:
      | Column       | Type      | Formula                    |
      | Prediction ID| Text      | AUTO_INCREMENT             |
      | Timestamp    | DateTime  | NOW()                      |
      | Symbol       | Text      | -                          |
      | Action       | Text      | BUY/SELL/HOLD              |
      | Entry Price  | Number    | -                          |
      | Target Price | Number    | -                          |
      | Confidence   | Percentage| 0-100%                     |
      | Timeframe    | Text      | 24h/48h/7d                 |
      | Result       | Text      | SUCCESS/FAIL/PENDING       |
      | Actual Price | Number    | -                          |
      | P&L %        | Formula   | =(Actual-Entry)/Entry*100  |
    Then the spreadsheet should calculate automatically
    And formulas should update in real-time
    And data validation should be enforced

  Scenario: Making Sheet Public
    Given the tracking sheet is created
    When I configure sharing settings
    And I set to "Anyone with link can view"
    And I publish to web
    And I get the public URL
    Then the sheet should be viewable without login
    And editing should be restricted
    And auto-refresh should be enabled

  Scenario: Calculating Accuracy Metrics
    Given predictions have been logged
    When I create the statistics formulas:
      | Metric          | Formula                                    |
      | Total Predictions| =COUNTA(A:A)-1                           |
      | Successful      | =COUNTIF(I:I,"SUCCESS")                   |
      | Failed          | =COUNTIF(I:I,"FAIL")                      |
      | Win Rate        | =Successful/Total*100                     |
      | Avg Confidence  | =AVERAGE(G:G)                              |
      | Total ROI       | =SUM(K:K)                                  |
    Then metrics should update automatically
    And accuracy should be transparent
    And calculations should be verifiable
```

## Feature: Historical Backtesting

```gherkin
Feature: Historical Backtesting
  As a credibility builder
  I want to backtest recent predictions
  So that I can prove historical accuracy

  Scenario: Collecting Historical Signals
    Given I need 20 past predictions
    When I analyze the last 30 days
    And I document each signal:
      | Date  | Symbol | Action | Target | Result  |
      | -30d  | BTC    | BUY    | +5%    | SUCCESS |
      | -28d  | ETH    | SELL   | -3%    | SUCCESS |
      | -26d  | SOL    | BUY    | +8%    | SUCCESS |
      | -24d  | ADA    | HOLD   | 0%     | SUCCESS |
      | ...   | ...    | ...    | ...    | ...     |
    Then I should have 20+ data points
    And results should be verifiable
    And timestamps should be accurate

  Scenario: Verifying 75% Accuracy
    Given I have 20 backtested predictions
    When I calculate the results:
      | Total | Success | Failed | Rate |
      | 20    | 15      | 5      | 75%  |
    Then accuracy should be â‰¥75%
    And failed trades should be included
    And no cherry-picking should occur

  Scenario: Creating Performance Visualization
    Given I have historical data
    When I create charts:
      | Chart Type    | Purpose                    |
      | Line Chart    | Equity curve over time     |
      | Bar Chart     | Win/Loss distribution      |
      | Pie Chart     | Success rate breakdown     |
      | Heat Map      | Confidence vs Accuracy     |
    Then visualizations should be clear
    And data should be accurate
    And charts should auto-update
```

## Feature: Live Prediction Logging

```gherkin
Feature: Live Prediction Logging
  As a real-time tracker
  I want to log predictions as they happen
  So that performance is continuously monitored

  Scenario: Automatic Prediction Logging
    Given the GPT generates a signal
    When the prediction includes:
      """
      Signal: BUY BTC
      Entry: $45,000
      Target: $47,000
      Stop Loss: $44,000
      Confidence: 78%
      Timeframe: 24 hours
      ID: #P2024-001
      """
    Then it should be logged automatically
    And timestamp should be recorded
    And status should be "PENDING"

  Scenario: Unique ID Generation
    Given predictions need tracking
    When a new prediction is made
    Then a unique ID should be generated:
      | Format      | Example       |
      | Prefix      | P              |
      | Year        | 2024          |
      | Sequential  | 001           |
      | Full ID     | P2024-001     |
    And IDs should never duplicate
    And they should be searchable

  Scenario: Outcome Verification Process
    Given prediction P2024-001 has 24h timeframe
    And 24 hours have passed
    When I check the outcome:
      | Target    | $47,000      |
      | Actual    | $47,500      |
      | Result    | SUCCESS      |
    Then the result should be updated
    And P&L should be calculated
    And statistics should refresh

  Scenario: Daily Summary Generation
    Given a day of trading has completed
    When generating the daily summary:
      """
      Daily Performance Summary - [Date]

      Total Predictions: 8
      Successful: 6
      Failed: 2
      Win Rate: 75%
      ROI: +12.3%

      Best Trade: BTC +8.5%
      Worst Trade: DOGE -3.2%
      """
    Then summary should be accurate
    And it should be posted publicly
    And users should be notified
```

## Feature: Transparency and Verification

```gherkin

  As a trustworthy service
  I want complete transparency
  So that users can verify all claims

  Scenario: Public Dashboard Access
    Given the performance dashboard exists
    When a user visits the public URL
    Then they should see:
      | Element                | Visible |
      | Current Win Rate       | Yes     |
      | Total Predictions      | Yes     |
      | Recent Predictions     | Yes     |
      | Verification Method    | Yes     |
      | Raw Data Export        | Yes     |
    And no login should be required
    And data should be real-time

  Scenario: Methodology Documentation
    Given users want to understand the system
    When they access methodology:
      """
      How We Track Performance:

      1. Every prediction is logged with timestamp
      2. Unique ID assigned for tracking
      3. Outcome checked after timeframe
      4. Success = Target reached within timeframe
      5. Failure = Stop loss hit or timeframe expired
      6. All results included (no cherry-picking)
      7. Public spreadsheet updated in real-time
      """
    Then methodology should be clear
    And it should be replicable
    And questions should be answered

  Scenario: User Verification Request
    Given a user doubts a prediction
    When they request verification of ID P2024-001
    Then they should receive:
      | Data Point      | Value                |
      | Timestamp       | 2024-01-01 10:30 UTC |
      | Symbol          | BTC                  |
      | Entry Price     | $45,000              |
      | Target          | $47,000              |
      | Actual Result   | $47,500 reached      |
      | Proof           | [Exchange link]      |
    And proof should be indisputable
    And response should be prompt

  Scenario: Handling Failed Predictions
    Given not all predictions succeed
    When a prediction fails
    Then it should be:
      | Action            | Status    |
      | Logged publicly   | Yes       |
      | Included in stats | Yes       |
      | Explained         | Yes       |
      | Hidden            | Never     |
    And transparency should be maintained
    And learning should be documented
