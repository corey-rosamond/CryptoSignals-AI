# ðŸ¥’ PHASE 7: FEEDBACK ITERATION - GHERKIN SCENARIOS

## Feature: Feedback Collection System

```gherkin
Feature: Comprehensive Feedback Collection
  As a product manager
  I want to collect all user feedback
  So that we can improve the product

  Background:
    Given the GPT has been launched
    And users have been using it
    And multiple feedback channels exist

  Scenario: In-GPT Feedback Collection
    Given user is using the GPT
    When they encounter an issue or have suggestion
    Then they can say "feedback: [message]"
    And feedback is logged with:
      | Field       | Value              |
      | User ID     | Anonymized hash    |
      | Timestamp   | 2024-01-15 14:30   |
      | Session     | Current context    |
      | Message     | User's feedback    |
      | Type        | Auto-classified    |
    And user receives acknowledgment:
      """
      Thank you for your feedback!
      We've logged your suggestion and will review it.
      """

  Scenario: Support Ticket Analysis
    Given support tickets are collected
    When analyzing tickets:
      | Ticket ID | Issue Type | Description              | Frequency |
      | T-001     | Bug        | Wrong price for SOL      | 12        |
      | T-002     | Feature    | Want alerts for ADA      | 8         |
      | T-003     | UX         | Confusing whale alerts   | 15        |
      | T-004     | Bug        | Timeout on analysis      | 6         |
    Then identify patterns
    And group similar issues
    And calculate impact score
    And prioritize by frequency

  Scenario: Community Feedback Mining
    Given feedback in communities:
      | Platform | Channel       | Messages | Sentiment |
      | Reddit   | Comments      | 156      | Mixed     |
      | Discord  | #feedback     | 89       | Positive  |
      | Twitter  | Replies       | 234      | Positive  |
      | Telegram | Group chat    | 67       | Neutral   |
    When mining for insights
    Then extract key themes:
      | Theme                  | Mentions | Priority |
      | More cryptocurrencies  | 45       | High     |
      | Faster updates        | 32       | Medium   |
      | Better explanations   | 28       | High     |
      | Custom alerts         | 41       | High     |

  Scenario Outline: Feedback Categorization
    Given user provides feedback: "<feedback>"
    When system categorizes it
    Then type should be "<type>"
    And priority should be "<priority>"

    Examples:
      | feedback                           | type     | priority |
      | "GPT crashes when I ask about SHIB"| Bug      | High    |
      | "Add support for Polygon"          | Feature  | Medium  |
      | "Make responses shorter"           | UX       | Low     |
      | "Data is 10 minutes old!"         | Bug      | Critical|
      | "Love it but need CSV export"     | Feature  | Medium  |
```

## Feature: Issue Prioritization

```gherkin
Feature: Smart Issue Prioritization
  As a development team
  I want prioritized issue list
  So that we fix important things first

  Scenario: Priority Scoring Algorithm
    Given an issue needs prioritization
    When calculating priority score:
      | Factor           | Weight | Score | Weighted |
      | User Impact      | 0.3    | 9     | 2.7      |
      | Frequency        | 0.25   | 7     | 1.75     |
      | Severity         | 0.25   | 8     | 2.0      |
      | Effort Required  | 0.2    | 3     | 0.6      |
    Then total score = 7.05
    And priority = "High"
    And add to sprint

  Scenario: Critical Bug Identification
    Given issue reported: "GPT returns wrong prices"
    When evaluating severity:
      | Check                  | Result    | Critical? |
      | Affects core function  | Yes       | âœ“         |
      | Data integrity issue   | Yes       | âœ“         |
      | User trust impact      | High      | âœ“         |
      | Workaround available   | No        | âœ“         |
    Then mark as "Critical"
    And assign immediately
    And notify team lead
    And track resolution time

  Scenario: Quick Win Identification
    Given list of improvements
    When identifying quick wins:
      | Issue                    | Effort | Impact | Quick Win? |
      | Fix typo in response     | 5 min  | Low    | Yes        |
      | Add coin to list         | 30 min | High   | Yes        |
      | Improve error message    | 15 min | Medium | Yes        |
      | Redesign algorithm       | 2 days | High   | No         |
      | Add new data source      | 1 week | High   | No         |
    Then batch quick wins together
    And implement in hotfix
    And deploy same day
```

## Feature: Bug Fix Implementation

```gherkin
Feature: Systematic Bug Resolution
  As a developer
  I want to fix bugs efficiently
  So that users have stable experience

  Scenario: API Timeout Fix
    Given users report timeout errors
    When investigating root cause:
      | Check                | Finding                |
      | API response time    | Sometimes >30 seconds  |
      | Current timeout      | Set to 10 seconds      |
      | Retry logic          | Not implemented        |
    Then implement fix:
      1. Increase timeout to 30 seconds
      2. Add exponential backoff retry
      3. Implement circuit breaker
      4. Add timeout warning to user
    And test with slow connection
    And verify fix works

  Scenario: Data Accuracy Improvement
    Given price data sometimes incorrect
    When debugging the issue:
      | Step               | Discovery              |
      | Check API response | Data is correct        |
      | Check parsing      | Decimal places wrong   |
      | Check caching      | Stale data served      |
    Then fix issues:
      1. Fix decimal parsing
      2. Reduce cache TTL to 3 minutes
      3. Add data validation
      4. Implement sanity checks
    And compare with live exchange
    And ensure <1% deviation

  Scenario: Error Message Enhancement
    Given users confused by errors
    When improving error handling:
      | Old Message          | New Message                      |
      | "Error occurred"     | "Unable to fetch BTC price. Retrying..." |
      | "Invalid input"      | "Please specify a valid crypto symbol (e.g., BTC, ETH)" |
      | "API failed"         | "Market data temporarily unavailable. Showing cached prices." |
    Then messages are helpful
    And suggest next actions
    And reduce support tickets
```

## Feature: Feature Enhancement

```gherkin
Feature: Implementing User Requests
  As a product owner
  I want to add requested features
  So that users get more value

  Scenario: Adding New Cryptocurrencies
    Given users want more coins
    When adding top requested:
      | Symbol | Name          | Requests |
      | MATIC  | Polygon       | 45       |
      | AVAX   | Avalanche     | 38       |
      | ATOM   | Cosmos        | 32       |
      | NEAR   | Near Protocol | 28       |
      | FTM    | Fantom        | 25       |
    Then update configuration
    And test data fetching
    And verify analysis works
    And announce new additions

  Scenario: Custom Alert Implementation
    Given users want custom alerts
    When implementing feature:
      | Alert Type        | Trigger Condition      |
      | Price Alert       | BTC > $50,000         |
      | Volume Spike      | 24h vol > 2x average  |
      | Whale Movement    | Transaction > $10M     |
      | Volatility Alert  | 1h change > 5%        |
    Then users can set alerts
    And receive notifications
    And manage alert list
    And see alert history

  Scenario: Analysis Depth Improvement
    Given users want deeper analysis
    When enhancing responses:
      | Before                    | After                          |
      | "BTC is up 3%"           | "BTC up 3% on 15% higher volume, breaking resistance at $45K" |
      | "Bullish signal"         | "Bullish: RSI oversold bounce, MACD crossing, volume increasing" |
      | "Whale alert"            | "Whale moved 1000 BTC ($45M) to Coinbase - possible sell pressure" |
    Then analysis is comprehensive
    And includes context
    And actionable insights
```
