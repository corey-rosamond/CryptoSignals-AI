## Feature: GPT Store Deployment

```gherkin
Feature: GPT Store Deployment
  As a developer
  I want to deploy the GPT to production
  So that users can start using it

  Background:
    Given all development phases complete
    And GPT thoroughly tested
    And assets prepared

  Scenario: Pre-deployment Validation
    Given I have the GPT ready
    When I run final checks:

      | Instructions       | Set    | Yes      |

      | Knowledge Base     | Loaded | Yes      |
      | Test Conversations | Passed | Yes      |
    Then all checks should pass
    And GPT should be deployment-ready

  Scenario: Store Listing Creation
    Given I'm creating the store listing
    When I provide listing details:
      | Field              | Content                           |

      | Conversation Start | "Analyze BTC", "Top gainers"      |
      | Thumbnail          | eye-catching-crypto-logo.png     |
    Then listing should be complete
    And preview should look professional
    And SEO keywords should be included

  Scenario: Publishing Process
    Given listing is complete
    When I click "Publish"
    Then GPT should be submitted
    And status should show "Under Review"
    And estimated time should be "2-4 hours"
    When review completes
    Then status changes to "Published"
    And public URL is generated
    And GPT appears in store search

  Scenario: Post-deployment Verification
    Given GPT is published
    When I test the live version:
      | Test                | Expected Result        |
      | Open GPT URL        | Loads successfully     |
      | Start conversation  | Responds correctly     |
      | Test main features  | All working            |
