# 🥒 PHASE 2: ENGAGEMENT MAXIMIZATION - GHERKIN SCENARIOS

## Feature: Conversation Multiplication

```gherkin
Feature: Conversation Multiplication System
  As a GPT developer
  I want users to have multiple conversations per session
  So that engagement metrics maximize

  Background:
    Given the GPT is configured for engagement
    And conversation hooks are enabled
    And gamification is active

  Scenario: Multi-Step Analysis Flow
    Given user asks "Analyze BTC"
    When GPT responds with analysis
    Then response should end with:
      """
      But wait, I noticed something unusual in the order flow...
      Want me to show you what the whales are doing?
      """
    And user should be prompted to continue
    And curiosity should be triggered

  Scenario: Progressive Depth Reveals
    Given user is engaged in analysis
    When providing information
    Then reveal should be progressive:
      | Step | Content                      | Hook                          |
      | 1    | Basic price analysis         | "But the real story is..."    |
      | 2    | Volume patterns              | "There's a hidden signal..."  |
      | 3    | Whale movements              | "Smart money is moving..."    |
      | 4    | Technical breakout           | "This could be huge..."       |
      | 5    | Risk/reward setup            | "Here's how to play it..."    |
    And each step should prompt next question

  Scenario: Cliffhanger Mechanics
    Given analysis is complete
    When ending response
    Then add cliffhanger:
      """
      Actually, I just noticed ETH is forming the same pattern...

      Should I check if this is a market-wide move?
      """
    And user engagement should continue
    And conversation should extend

  Scenario: Follow-Up Question Generation
    Given user receives analysis
    When GPT completes response
    Then suggest follow-ups:
      | Type          | Question                                |
      | Deeper        | "Want the advanced technical breakdown?" |
      | Related       | "Should I check correlated assets?"      |
      | Comparison    | "How does this compare to yesterday?"    |
      | Prediction    | "Want my 24-hour forecast?"              |
      | Challenge     | "Think you can beat my prediction?"      |
```

## Feature: Daily Return Mechanics

```gherkin
Feature: Daily Return System
  As a user
  I want reasons to check daily
  So that it becomes a habit

  Scenario: Morning Market Brief
    Given it's 9 AM user timezone
    When user opens GPT
    Then display:
      """
      🔥 Day 7 Streak! Don't break it!

      While you slept:
      • BTC moved 5.2% (I predicted this!)
      • Whale alert: $50M moved to exchanges
      • Your paper portfolio: +$234 overnight

      Today's challenge: Can you predict ETH's direction?
      """
    And streak should be emphasized
    And FOMO should be created

  Scenario: Streak System
    Given user has daily streak
    When checking streak status:
      | Days | Reward              | Message                    |
      | 1    | 10 points           | "Great start!"             |
      | 3    | 50 points           | "You're on fire!"          |
      | 7    | 100 points + badge  | "Week streak! Share it?"   |
      | 30   | 500 points + title  | "Legend status unlocked!"  |
    Then celebrate milestones
    And prompt sharing
    And fear breaking streak

  Scenario: Daily Challenge System
    Given new day starts
    When presenting challenge:
      """
      📅 Today's Challenge: "Market Prophet"

      Make 3 correct predictions in a row
      Reward: 100 bonus points + Prophet badge

      23 users have already completed this!
      """
    Then create urgency
    And show social proof
    And track completion

  Scenario: FOMO Generation
    Given user hasn't visited today
    When they return
    Then show what they missed:
      """
      While you were away:
      • 3 major whale movements detected
      • SOL pumped 15% (we called it!)
      • 45 users hit new profit records
      • You lost your 5-day streak 😢
