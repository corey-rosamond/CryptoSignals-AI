## 📚 ESSENTIAL DOCUMENTS (Always Read First)

### 1. Engineering Standards
**[STANDARDS.md](./STANDARDS.md)**
- MUST READ FIRST - Contains critical engineering principles
- Never claim completion without verification
- Always follow PLAN → GHERKIN → UML → CODE workflow
- Be honest about what's done and what's not

### 2. Project Status & Tasks
**[UNDONE.md](./UNDONE.md)**
- Current list of incomplete tasks
- What has been verified vs claimed
- Priority order for implementation

### 3. Development Location & GPT Constraints
**IMPORTANT: All development happens in `/GPTs/01_Crypto_Signals/` directory**
- This is where the actual GPT code/configuration lives
- Never develop in the .ai directory (this is documentation only)
- The .ai directory is for planning and tracking only

**🚨 CRITICAL: GPT Character Limits**
- **GPT Instructions MUST be under 8,000 characters**
- **GPT Description MUST be under 300 characters** (Platform limit!)
- `GPT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` is now optimized at 5,200 characters (compliant)
- Detailed protocols moved to knowledge files:
  - `Engagement_System.md` - Complete conversation multiplication system
  - `Gamification_System.md` - Full point/level/achievement system
  - `Risk_Management_Toolkit.md` - Detailed risk protocols
  - `Technical_Analysis_Guide.md` - Complete analysis methodology

## 🎯 CURRENT PHASE DOCUMENTS

### Phase 8: Optimization (Current Phase)
**Status: READY TO START** (Requires live user data)
**Location:** [./phase/phase_8/](./phase/phase_8/)

**Phase 8 Focus:** A/B testing, conversion optimization, and retention improvements based on real user metrics

**Note:** Phase 8 requires the GPT to be deployed and have active users to gather data for optimization

## 🔄 WORKFLOW REMINDER

For EVERY task:
1. Read STANDARDS.md
2. Check UNDONE.md for task
3. Read phase PLAN.md (in .ai/phase/phase_X/)
4. Read phase GHERKIN.md (test scenarios)
5. Read phase UML.md (architecture)
6. **DEVELOP in `/GPTs/01_Crypto_Signals/` directory**
7. Test against GHERKIN scenarios
8. Mark complete ONLY when verified working

When phase is VERIFIED complete:
1. ✅ Update UNDONE.md - mark phase as complete
2. ✅ Update START.md - point to next phase
3. ✅ Move completed phase to "Completed Phases" section
4. ✅ Update current phase pointer

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL REMINDERS

1. **NEVER claim something works without testing**
2. **ALWAYS be honest about completion status**
3. **IGNORE the `/plan/` directory unless explicitly in planning mode**
4. **DEVELOP in `/GPTs/01_Crypto_Signals/` directory ONLY**
5. **KEEP PROJECT CLEAN**:
   - Remove test files when done
   - Delete legacy/duplicate files
   - Only ONE `GPT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` in `config/`
   - Only ONE deployment guide (no duplicates)
   - Organize files in proper directories
6. **DUAL REVENUE: GPT Store usage + Gumroad upsells**
7. **Core features FREE to maximize usage**
8. **Upsell Gumroad products after delivering value**
9. **NO social media management (no Discord/Reddit/Twitter)**
10. **Goal: 10,000+ DAU with 2-5% converting to Gumroad**

## 🚫 DO NOT WRITE PYTHON CODE

**IMPORTANT:** GPTs cannot execute Python code! They only work with:
- Natural language instructions (GPT_INSTRUCTIONS.md)
- Knowledge files (Markdown, PDF, text)
- Conversation patterns and templates

**NEVER CREATE:**
- Python scripts (.py files)
- JavaScript code
- Any executable code
- API integrations that require code execution

**ONLY CREATE:**
- GPT instruction documents
- Knowledge base files
- Response templates
- Conversation flows
- Markdown documentation

## 📝 NOTES FOR AI

### Directory Structure:
- **`.ai/`** = Documentation and planning ONLY (you are here)
- **`/GPTs/01_Crypto_Signals/`** = ACTUAL development directory
- **`.ai/plan/`** = IGNORE unless explicitly planning (not for development reference)
- **`.ai/phase/phase_X/`** = Current phase docs to implement

### Development Rules:
- **Dual Revenue Model:**
  - Primary: GPT Store usage payments (maximize conversations)
  - Secondary: Gumroad upsells (2-5% conversion target)
- **7 Gumroad Products Available:** ($27-$197 price range)
  - Advanced Trading Toolkit, Whale Alert System, Risk Calculator, etc.
  - Links in main PLAN.md for reference
- Upsell AFTER delivering value, never gate core features
- Focus on making it addictive and viral
- User should not need to manage communities
- Growth through in-GPT viral mechanics only
- ALL actual GPT configuration/code goes in `/GPTs/01_Crypto_Signals/`
