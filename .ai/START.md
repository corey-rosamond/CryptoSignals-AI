# 🚀 START HERE - AI PROJECT ENTRY POINT

## 📍 Current Phase: PHASE 2 - Knowledge Base Creation

Welcome AI! This is your navigation hub for the CryptoSignals AI GPT project. Read the documents in order below to understand and implement the current phase.

---

## 📚 ESSENTIAL DOCUMENTS (Always Read First)

### 1. Engineering Standards
**[STANDARDS.md](./STANDARDS.md)**
- MUST READ FIRST - Contains critical engineering principles
- Never claim completion without verification
- Always follow PLAN → GHERKIN → UML → CODE workflow
- Be honest about what's done and what's not

### 2. Project Status & Tasks
**[UNDONE.md](./UNDONE.md)**
- Current list of incomplete tasks
- What has been verified vs claimed
- Priority order for implementation

### 3. Development Location
**IMPORTANT: All development happens in `/GPTs/01_Crypto_Signals/` directory**
- This is where the actual GPT code/configuration lives
- Never develop in the .ai directory (this is documentation only)
- The .ai directory is for planning and tracking only

## 🎯 CURRENT PHASE DOCUMENTS

### Phase 2: Knowledge Base Creation (Next Phase)
**Status: IN PROGRESS**

**Note:** Phases 0 and 1 have been completed and CryptoSignals AI has been successfully launched!

---

## 📈 PROJECT STATUS

### Completed Phases ✅
- **Phase 0**: Pre-Launch Setup - COMPLETED 2024-09-24
  - ChatGPT Plus account verified

## 🔄 WORKFLOW REMINDER

For EVERY task:
1. Read STANDARDS.md
2. Check UNDONE.md for task
3. Read phase PLAN.md (in .ai/phase/phase_X/)
4. Read phase GHERKIN.md (test scenarios)
5. Read phase UML.md (architecture)
6. **DEVELOP in `/GPTs/01_Crypto_Signals/` directory**
7. Test against GHERKIN scenarios
8. Mark complete ONLY when verified working

When phase is VERIFIED complete:
1. ✅ Update UNDONE.md - mark phase as complete
2. ✅ Update START.md - point to next phase
3. ✅ Move completed phase to "Completed Phases" section
4. ✅ Update current phase pointer

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL REMINDERS

1. **NEVER claim something works without testing**
2. **ALWAYS be honest about completion status**
3. **IGNORE the `/plan/` directory unless explicitly in planning mode**
4. **DEVELOP in `/GPTs/01_Crypto_Signals/` directory ONLY**
5. **DUAL REVENUE: GPT Store usage + Gumroad upsells**
6. **Core features FREE to maximize usage**
7. **Upsell Gumroad products after delivering value**
8. **NO social media management (no Discord/Reddit/Twitter)**
9. **Goal: 10,000+ DAU with 2-5% converting to Gumroad**

## 📝 NOTES FOR AI

### Directory Structure:
- **`.ai/`** = Documentation and planning ONLY (you are here)
- **`/GPTs/01_Crypto_Signals/`** = ACTUAL development directory
- **`.ai/plan/`** = IGNORE unless explicitly planning (not for development reference)
- **`.ai/phase/phase_X/`** = Current phase docs to implement

### Development Rules:
- **Dual Revenue Model:**
  - Primary: GPT Store usage payments (maximize conversations)
  - Secondary: Gumroad upsells (2-5% conversion target)
- **7 Gumroad Products Available:** ($27-$197 price range)
  - Advanced Trading Toolkit, Whale Alert System, Risk Calculator, etc.
  - Links in main PLAN.md for reference
- Upsell AFTER delivering value, never gate core features
- Focus on making it addictive and viral
- User should not need to manage communities
- Growth through in-GPT viral mechanics only
- ALL actual GPT configuration/code goes in `/GPTs/01_Crypto_Signals/`

---

## 🔗 Quick Links

- **Development Directory:** `/GPTs/01_Crypto_Signals/` (CREATE ALL CODE HERE)
- **Current Phase Docs:** [./phase/phase_0/](./phase/phase_0/)
- **All Phases:** [./phase/](./phase/)
- **Standards:** [STANDARDS.md](./STANDARDS.md)
- **Task Tracker:** [UNDONE.md](./UNDONE.md)

### ⚠️ DO NOT USE FOR DEVELOPMENT:
- ❌ [./plan/](./plan/) - Planning reference only, IGNORE during development

**Last Updated:** Phase 0 - Starting
**Next Update:** When Phase 0 is verified complete

> Remember: Read STANDARDS.md first, always be honest about completion, and never skip the GHERKIN tests!
