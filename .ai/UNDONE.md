## üìù NOTES FOR AI

### When Working on This Project:
1. **Check this file first** to see what needs to be done
2. **Update task status** as you work (NOT STARTED ‚Üí IN PROGRESS ‚Üí DONE)
3. **Create files in logical order** - configuration before knowledge base
4. **Test everything** - each component should work independently
5. **Document everything** - clear comments and instructions
6. **Maintain consistency** - follow established patterns and styles

### Priority Order:
1. GPT Instructions (brain of the system)
2. Knowledge Base (content to reference)
3. Monetization Setup (revenue generation)
4. Performance Tracking (credibility)
5. Everything else

### File Naming Convention:
- Configuration: `GPT_[NAME].md`
- Knowledge: `[Topic]_Guide.pdf` or `.md`
