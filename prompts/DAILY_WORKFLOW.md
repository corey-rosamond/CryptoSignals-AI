## Quick Copy Guide

### For GPT (Step 1):
```
Analyze the current crypto market and give me ONE high-confidence trading prediction. Format it EXACTLY like this:

Asset: [COIN/USD]
Signal: [BUY/SELL/HOLD]
Entry: [price number only]
Target: [price number only]
StopLoss: [price number only]
Confidence: [number only, no %]
Timeframe: [1H/2H/3H/4H/6H/12H/1D]
Notes: [one line analysis]
```

### For Claude (Step 2):
```
Add this GPT prediction to GitHub:

[PASTE GPT OUTPUT HERE]

Repository: /mnt/c/Users/rosam/Documents/Passive Income/GPT Tools/GPTs/01_Crypto_Signals
CSV file: data/performance.csv
SSH key: /home/corey/.ssh/crypto_signals_deploy_key

Please:
1. Add it to the CSV with the next ID number
2. Use current date/time
3. Commit with message: "GPT Prediction: [ID] - [Asset] [Signal] @ [Price] ([Confidence]% confidence)"
4. Push to GitHub
5. Confirm it was added successfully
```
