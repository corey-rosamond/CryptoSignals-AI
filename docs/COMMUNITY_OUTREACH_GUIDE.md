## 📝 Platform-Specific Strategies

### Reddit Strategy

#### DO's:
- ✅ Provide value first (answer questions, share insights)
- ✅ Follow each subreddit's rules carefully
- ✅ Engage genuinely for 1-2 weeks before posting
- ✅ Use the 9:1 rule (9 helpful comments per 1 promotional post)
- ✅ Post during peak hours (check RedditLater)
- ✅ Respond to every comment within 2 hours

#### DON'Ts:
- ❌ Spam multiple subreddits simultaneously
- ❌ Use obvious promotional language

- ❌ Use multiple accounts (ban risk)

#### Reddit Post Templates:

**Educational Angle:**
```
Title: What I learned paper trading for 30 days with AI assistance

Been using an AI tool to practice trading with virtual money. Started with $10K, now at $11.2K after 30 days.

Key learnings:
- Risk management > picking winners
- 4H timeframes work better than 15min
- Stop losses saved me 5 times
- AI analysis helped spot patterns I missed

The tool tracks 78.5% accuracy on its predictions. Not promoting anything, just sharing what's working for me.

Happy to share the tool if anyone's interested in practicing risk-free.
```

**Value-First Angle:**
```
Title: Free resources for learning crypto trading (no courses/paid groups)

After losing money with "gurus", I found these free resources:

1. TradingView for charts
2. CoinGecko for data
3. This AI GPT for analysis/paper trading
4. YouTube (CoinBureau, Benjamin Cowen)
5. Discord communities

The GPT gives you $10K virtual to practice with. Been using it for a month - helped me understand risk management without losing real money.

What free resources do you use?
```

### Discord Strategy

#### Approach:
1. Join 2-3 servers maximum
2. Contribute for 1 week minimum
3. Build reputation first
4. Share in appropriate channels only
5. Offer to help others

#### Message Template:
```
Hey everyone! 👋

Been testing this AI crypto tool that lets you paper trade with $10K virtual money. Real prices, no risk.

What I like:
• Updates every 5 min
• 78% accurate signals
• Weekly competitions
• Achievement system

Perfect for testing strategies before using real money.

Anyone else paper trading? What tools do you use?
```

### Twitter/X Strategy

#### Growth Tactics:
1. **Thread Strategy**: Weekly educational threads
2. **Reply Guy**: Respond to big accounts with value
3. **Quote Tweets**: Add insights to trending topics
4. **Spaces**: Join and contribute to Twitter Spaces
5. **Consistency**: 3-5 tweets daily

## ⚠️ Crisis Management

### Common Issues & Responses:

**"It's not working"**
```
Sorry to hear that! Can you try:
1. Refreshing the page
2. Starting a new chat
3. Saying "reset" in the conversation

If still not working, please share details and I'll fix ASAP!
```

**"This is a scam"**
```
I understand the concern. Few points:
- It's paper trading only (no real money)
- Open source on GitHub
- No payment required for core features
- 100+ active users already

Just trying to help people learn safely!
```

**"Why do I need ChatGPT Plus?"**
```
ChatGPT Plus is required for all custom GPTs (OpenAI's requirement, not mine). The GPT itself is free, but you need the $20/mo ChatGPT subscription to access any custom GPTs.

Working on a standalone version for the future!
```
