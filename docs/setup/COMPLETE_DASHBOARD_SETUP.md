## üîß Formula Explanations (Already Included!)

### Win Rate Formula (Cell B2):
```
=COUNTIF(K18:K1000,"WIN")/(COUNTIF(K18:K1000,"WIN")+COUNTIF(K18:K1000,"LOSS"))
```
Counts WINs divided by total completed trades

### Asset Performance (Cells B11-B14):
```
=COUNTIFS(D18:D1000,"BTC/USD",K18:K1000,"WIN")/COUNTIFS(D18:D1000,"BTC/USD",K18:K1000,"<>PENDING")
```
Calculates win rate for specific assets

### ROI Calculation (Column N):
For each trade, manually calculate:
- Long trades: ((Exit - Entry) / Entry) √ó 100
- Short trades: ((Entry - Exit) / Entry) √ó 100

- Start with 5 manual entries to get comfortable
- Share your public dashboard link immediately

---

## üö® Troubleshooting

### If formulas show #DIV/0:
- Normal for empty data
- Will fix once you have trades
- Need at least 1 WIN and 1 LOSS

### If formulas show #ERROR:
- Check semicolons vs commas (regional settings)
- European sheets use ; instead of ,
- US sheets use , instead of ;

### To fix formula regional issues:
Replace all ; with , in formulas if you're in US
Or replace all , with ; if you're in Europe
