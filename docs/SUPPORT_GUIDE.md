## 🛠️ Common Fixes Database

### Paper Trading Issues

**Problem**: Portfolio not saving
```
Fix: Portfolio saves within conversation only
Note: Each conversation = separate portfolio
Solution: Continue in same chat
```

**Problem**: Trades not executing
```
Fix: Use exact format: "Buy 0.1 BTC" or "Sell all ETH"
Note: Include amount and ticker
Solution: Check supported formats
```

**Problem**: Negative balance
```
Fix: Cannot go negative, trades auto-rejected
Note: Check available balance first
Solution: Sell positions to free up capital
```

### Analysis Issues

**Problem**: Analysis seems generic
```
Fix: Be specific in request
Good: "Analyze BTC/USD for day trading"
Bad: "What about Bitcoin?"
```

**Problem**: Confidence scores missing
```
Fix: Ask explicitly for confidence
Example: "Analyze ETH with confidence score"
```

### Competition Issues

**Problem**: Not showing on leaderboard
```
Fix: Make at least one trade
Note: $10,000 portfolio = not ranked
Solution: Execute any trade to appear
```

**Problem**: Rank not updating
